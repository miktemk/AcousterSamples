AcousterSamples
===============

> NOTE: these were written in Eclipse and not Andoid Studio + Gradle. I have not yet had a chance to convert these projects to Gradle. Work in progress baby!

Sample apps that run on top of the AcousterCommon libraries

 - **org.acouster.EyeFitness** - Android-independent library for `zterminal.EyeFitness`
 - **zterminal.EyeFitness** - Eye exercises. Relies on `org.acouster.EyeFitness`
 - **zterminal.GuitarPractice** - Simple app to display photographed pages in a scrollable manner. Uses touch as well as keyboard. Originally used to have presentable guitar sheet music on a tablet without the common image apps (Gallery) timing out or zooming in/out uselessly.
 - **zterminal.KiaiReaction** - WIP. Uses gyroscope to test your reaction time when you jiggle your phone in the direction of the arrow.
 - **zterminal.KyoForAndroid** - WIP. Takes several photographs and constructs an animated interactive avatar that you can slap around. (Excellent for pictures of your ex!)
 - **zterminal.LingoRepeater** - Reads from an XML file and uses text to speech to speak out random phrases for language practicing
 - **zterminal.Platinum** - A GUI for language lessons borrowed from 3rd party.
